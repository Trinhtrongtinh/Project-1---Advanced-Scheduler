Pintos is a simple OS written in C that runs on 32-bit x86 architecture. It's partially implemented and it's up to you to add various features and enhancements. For more information see http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos.html.

This is a complete implementation that passes all tests.
